## Why AI-Procurement-Buddy?

Procurement teams often face time-consuming tasks such as searching for suppliers, gathering accurate contact details, and crafting formal communication. This assistant simplifies those steps by:

- **Automating supplier discovery** via smart search queries powered by Serper API and advanced filtering to avoid low-quality directories.
- **Extracting accurate contact info** like emails, international phone numbers, and postal addresses using a combination of regex and LLM-powered parsing.
- **Drafting professional quotation emails** tailored to user needs with minimal input.
- **Routing user queries dynamically** between discovery and email drafting workflows to save time and reduce manual effort.
- Providing a **modern, responsive UI** using Streamlit, accessible to non-technical users.
- Optionally supporting **LangGraph** for orchestrating complex AI workflows as modular graphs — making the system highly extensible.
